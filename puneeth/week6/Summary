This is a summary of the graphs and code for Week 6 assignemt.
There are two main code files, SIR_SIRS.py and Lockdown_Quarantine.py, and a side file, distributions.py, which contains some methods and distributions 
that are used in the new main files 

1.) SIR_SIRS.py
This contains two classes to simulate two continuous-time stochastic epidemic models, namely, SIR and SIRS.
For both the models we have three classes S-Susceptible, I-Infected and R-Recovered. We also keep track of the D-Deaths. 

SIR Dig: S -v-> I -g-> R and -b-> S and I -u-> D
i.e. bS - birth rate; vSI - infection rate; gI - recovery rate; uI - death rate due to infection
Note: birth rate and death rate are not equal. 

The SIRS model only differs in that there is a possibility of that recovered individuals lose their immunity and become susceptible again. 
SIRS Dig: S -v-> I -g-> R -w-> S and -b-> S and I -u-> D
i.e. bS - birth rate; vSI - infection rate; gI - recovery rate; uI - death rate due to infection; wR - Immunity loss rate
Note: birth rate and death rate are not equal. 

Note: SIRS with w=0 is the same as the SIR model

Plots: Effect_b, Effect_v, Effect_u, Effect_g shows the effect of increasing the respective parameters on dynamics (One instance of the model is ploted) 
and Mean Pop Size (computed over 1000 runs) for both the models (1st row = SIR and 2nd row = SIRS)

2.) Lockdown_Quarantine.py 
This contains two extensions to the SIRS to analyze the effect of lockdown and quarantining. The two classes correspond to having a single lockdown period
or multiple lockdown periods.
